Heed the call of the wild in the Mocroco moccasin from Perlina, a low-profile slip-on with sass. With bold stitching detail at the heel and toe, the croco patent or calf hair upper will jazz up any casual look. Lined in smooth leather, the double-stitched rubber sole offers lightly textured grip for walking or driving.
