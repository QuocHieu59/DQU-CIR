Always in style, the Monroe slingback from Two Lips is a classic. This pump has a pointy toe and a slim heel for a silhouette that can go from work to dinner with ease; an adjustable strap with a buckle ensures a custom fit. The leather upper and just-right heel height make this a dress shoe you'll choose often.
