The GEL-V Cut Turf shoe from ASICS performs like a champ on synthetic or hard-ground fields. Featuring the HG10mm heel set-up with a higher upper height, this rugged shoe offers enhanced ankle support and running efficiency. The PGuard toe protector lends durability, and the GEL cushioning system absorbs shock.
