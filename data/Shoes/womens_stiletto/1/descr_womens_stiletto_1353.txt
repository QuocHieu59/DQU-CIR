Sparkly jewels add a splash of color to this poised yet playful pump from Kate Spade. Crafted with a soft suede upper, the Sebbie features classic low-cut sides, a subtly squared toe and matching stiletto heel. The shoe's feminine shape makes it the perfect match for the season's slim-fitting A-line skirts.
