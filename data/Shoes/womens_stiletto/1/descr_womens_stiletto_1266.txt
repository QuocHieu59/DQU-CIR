Be the center of attention with this eye-catching pair of party pumps! The Kudrow from Guess is a charcoal grey pump with a slightly pointed toe, a 4 inch stiletto heel, and a 1/2 inch platform. Bold yellow accents at the heel and along the platform give this heel an adventurous, fashion-forward flair.
