Ready for Spring? You will be when this little lovely from Beverly Feldman arrives. The Pilar sandal features a d'Orsay cut and a strappy peep-toe on a pretty, stacked stiletto heel, with a snake-embossed upper in a vibrant, warm-weather-ready palette--all to help you chase the winter blues far, far away.
