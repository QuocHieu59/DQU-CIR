Deceptively cute, the Encore Adams slip-on from Merrell is ready to take on anything. A suede upper looks good, while an antimicrobial Nylex sockliner wicks moisture away. An Ortholite footbed and a Q-Form footframe with integrated Air Cushion midsole provide support, and an all-season sticky rubber sole.
