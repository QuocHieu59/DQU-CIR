For casual style that stands out, try the Gramercy-Newbury from Rhino Red. The low profile is urban-chic, while the rhinestone accents and embroidered logo panels demand attention. A trio of hook-and-loop closures keep the look secure, and its cushy interior ensures your steps are as comfy as they are sharp.
