Slip into a sleek tall boot with a differencethe June boot from Franco Sarto. The leather upper has full-length elastic goring on both sides for a snug fit and easy slip-on wear. A strap and buckle detail add interest, while a very sensible height on the stacked wooden heel, plus a rubber sole mean comfort and traction.
