A classic in smooth, rich leather, this is a go-anywhere (and goes-with-anything) boot that we're going to love for seasons to come. For a snugger fit, order a half-size down. Leather lining. Partial inside zip. Rubber sole with rubber forepart for better traction. 1 1/4" stacked heel with a rough finish. Import.
