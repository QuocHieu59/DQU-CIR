The Collins boot from Kate Spade offers classic equestrian-inspired styling. Its luxe suede upper, sophisticated seaming, and gleaming logoed studs on the pull tabs create a look that's crisp and versatile. Its textured synthetic outsole and low sturdy heel make it as easy to walk in as it is chic.
