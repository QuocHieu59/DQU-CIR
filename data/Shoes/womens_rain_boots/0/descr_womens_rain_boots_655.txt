What is cuter than cute? Hello Kitty! Especially when she is printed all over a rainboot. This punk-inspired boot from Chooka has a rubber upper, a grooved rubber outsole for traction on wet and dry surfaces, and a moisture-absorbing fabric lining that will keep your tootsies and footsies temperate and dry.
